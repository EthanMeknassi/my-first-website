    <h2>Camera Trap with Web Interface Design for wildlife monitoring</h2>
    <img src="./cameratrap.webp"height="250" alt=""/>
    <p>The ESP32 Camera Trap project enhances desert bird monitoring using an embedded camera system. 
        It encompasses sections for sensor control, camera setup, protection mechanisms, 
        and battery management.
        <br/></p>
        <p>By wirelessly integrating components and providing a user-friendly web interface, 
            the system captures bird behavior while minimizing habitat disruption.</p>

    <h2>Data Transfer Microcontroller</h2>
    <img src="./datatransfer.webp"height="250" alt=""/>
    <p>The SHARC buoy's data transfer microcontroller project involves encryption, compression, and data processing. 
        Requirements were established through research, leading to defined test procedures. Algorithms, like "DEFLATE" and "AES-256," 
        were initially chosen for speed and efficiency but later switched to "bzip2." Challenges in data transmission timing were tackled 
        due to microcontroller limitations and C language usage. Simulations validated algorithms, considering compression ratios and data integrity.
        <br/></p>
        <p>
        The IMU sensor underwent testing for accurate data reading and formatting. 
        The overall system and subsystems were rigorously tested, aligning with Acceptable Test Procedures. 
        The agile design method facilitated client involvement, ensuring iterative development.</p>

    <h2></h2>
    <img src="./minihelicopter.webp"height="250" alt=""/>
    <p>This project aimed to create a controller for a mini helicopter to hover at a specific height. 
        MATLAB simulations helped design the controller, which was then tested practically on a breadboard.
        The final controller had a proportional gain of k=10 and a phase-lead component. 
        Both simulations and tests met overshoot specs, despite minor variations due to component uncertainties.
        Practical settling time was longer due to component traits. 
        Sinusoidal tracking deviations were caused by non-linearity and noise.
        <br/></p>
        <p>To enhance results, suggestions included noise reduction, parameter refinement, and component improvement. 
        Transitioning to soldered components was advised to decrease uncertainties.</p>
